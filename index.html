            <p class="subtitle">A guide for English speakers (18+ years old)</p>
            <div class="important-note">
                <strong>Note:</strong> This guide is for people 18 years and older. It does not cover learner permits for 17-year-olds. This information was compiled to help students at Fahrschule Karlsplatz reduce email inquiries.

            <h2>About Fahrschule Karlsplatz</h2>
            <p>We chose <a href="https://fahrschule-karlsplatz.at/" class="link" target="_blank">Fahrschule Karlsplatz</a> as it appears to be one of the only English-speaking driving schools in Vienna. This guide is based on our experience enrolling our 18-year-old son Max, who needed to complete the process quickly before starting university in Scotland.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Step-by-Step Process</h2>
            
            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Initial Registration</h3>
                <p>Visit the driving school with your passport and immigration card. Sign up for classes and pay the fees. At this point, you can also request an "L" sign for your car if you plan to practice privately (though we opted for official lessons only due to time constraints).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>2. Medical Examination (Do This ASAP)</h3>
                <p>You need to visit an approved doctor to complete a health form with an official stamp. This must be submitted to the state police as early as possible in the process.</p>
                <p><strong>Approved doctors list (Summer 2025):</strong><br>
                <a href="https://www.polizei.gv.at/wien/files_wien/Sachverstaendigenliste_bf_20250612.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">Official Doctor's List PDF</a></p>
                <p><strong>Submit the form here:</strong><br>
                <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7San29RD8QDFiagQ7" class="link" target="_blank">State Police Office Location</a></p>
                <p>Go to the information desk and ask them to deliver it to the correct office. The form is available at the doctor's office and covers basic health questions and concerns.</p>
                <p><em>Alternative:</em> The driving school has a doctor who visits periodically - check with them for dates and times.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>3. Wait for System Processing</h3>
                <p>After submitting the health form, it takes a couple of weeks to be "in the system." No mail confirmation is sent - you'll need to check with the school to confirm your status.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>4. Theory Classes</h3>
                <p>Attend 9 theory classes in a classroom setting. These are scheduled regularly throughout the week, and you can attend as your schedule permits. You must complete all theory classes before you can register for the theory exam.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>5. Practical Driving Lessons</h3>
                <p>Book practical driving lessons with an instructor. These must be scheduled in advance, and slots fill up quickly. You can book lessons before your health form is processed, but you cannot actually take them until you're "in the system."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>6. Theory Exam Registration</h3>
                <p>Once you've completed all 9 theory classes and your health form is processed, you can register for the theory exam. This must be done in person at the driving school office.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>7. Night Driving Course</h3>
                <p>After completing 8-9 driving lessons, your instructor will determine if you're ready for the night driving course. You cannot schedule this in advance - it requires instructor approval first.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>8. Final Driving Exam</h3>
                <p>The official driving exam is scheduled jointly between the driving school and the police department once you've completed all requirements.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The entire process can take several months due to scheduling availability and processing times, so start early. The most important step is getting your health examination done immediately after registration, as this creates the longest delay. Once you're in the system, the rest of the process flows more quickly.</p>
